        <h1 MadCap:autonum="">4 | View test results in a report</h1>
        <p>To view test results in a report, from the top menu, select <strong>Test Analysis</strong>.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Test Analysis</strong> view presents your test results on the following tabs that present different views of the result data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://developers.perfectomobile.com/display/PD/CI+Dashboard+view">CI Dashboard</a>:</strong>&#160;Displays the history of the test results, grouped based on the CI jobname identifier. Here, you can track your CI/CD pipeline and scheduled builds/jobs.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://developers.perfectomobile.com/display/PD/Heatmap+view">Heatmap</a>:</strong>&#160;Displays a graphic overview of different cross-sections of the test results. You can group test results by two levels of characterizations –&#160;devices or specific tags. The different groups are color-coded based on the distribution of passed or failed tests.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://developers.perfectomobile.com/display/PD/Report+Library">Report Library</a>:</strong>&#160;Displays a list of all single test reports for the Perfecto Lab, along with recorded videos and screenshots. You can filter the listing to focus on a set of tests with a particular tag or drill down to view the full report. The tags may be execution-level context tags or specific test tags. You can also <a href="https://developers.perfectomobile.com/display/PD/Export+reports">export reports</a> in PDF format or as JSON data.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://developers.perfectomobile.com/display/PD/Live+Stream">Live Stream</a>:</strong>&#160;Displays a list of test executions currently in progress and allows you to stop one or more executions at once if needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, you can drill down to view the&#160;<strong><a href="https://developers.perfectomobile.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=31104900">Single Test Report (STR)</a></strong>&#160;for a specific test.
